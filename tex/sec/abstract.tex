In the framework of String Theory, we try to use information available in public datasets concerning configuration matrices of Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds to predict the characteristic Hodge numbers $h_{11}$ and $h_{21}$ using machine learning techniques (including neural networks and ensemble learning).
