# Machine Learning for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds

We consider a machine learning approach to the issue related to the prediction
of the **Hodge numbers** ($h_{11}$ and $h_{21}$) of **Calabi-Yau 3-folds**.

 We consider several algorithms in order to reproduce them through a
**regression** task. We also implement some **convolutional neural networks** to
help the predictions and ultimately stack them in order to produce the best
result.
