# Machine Learning for Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau 3-folds

We consider a machine learning approach to predict the **Hodge numbers** of
**Calabi-Yau 3-folds**.

We consider several algorithms in order to reproduce them through a
**regression** task. We start from simpler algorithms and move to
**convolutional neural networks** to process the configuration matrices of the
manifolds.
